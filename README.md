*Nobody* should feel like they are just a number, including participants in clinical trials who play a significant role in making medical advancements. SubjectOne is a portal for patients and trial coordinators to help patients feel more informed and cared for throughout the duration of the trial. Patients are able to easily communicate with their coordinator, and coordinators are able to track their patients' questions and emotional status.
